In lands of ancient lore, where stories blend,
There walks a figure, both hero and friend.
Kvothe, a flame-haired bard of mysteries deep,
His tale of wonder, a promise to keep.

From Edema Ruh, a caravan's embrace,
His parents' love, a fleeting grace.
Yet in their hearts, they left a spark,
A thirst for knowledge, a quest to embark.

Through trials and turmoil, he finds his way,
In Tarbean's streets, a beggar's dismay.
But music calls, a lute in hand,
His fingers dance, the world understands.

With wit and charm, he seeks to learn,
At University, where secrets churn.
In arcane arts, he weaves his might,
The Name of the Wind, a power in sight.

In Eolian's halls, his voice resounds,
A symphony of magic, hearts astound.
A friendship forged, with loyal ties,
His friends stand by him, through lows and highs.

In search of truth, the Chandrian's veil,
Their dark deeds whispered in every tale.
He seeks revenge, their secrets to unveil,
The mystery of their name, to assail.

In love's embrace, with Denna's grace,
A connection profound, they both chase.
Yet fate's cruel hand, their paths divide,
Their hearts entwined, but worlds collide.

Through trials and heartaches, his spirit's tested,
His resilience, a flame untested.
A legend in the making, a hero's call,
In Name of the Wind, he'll rise and fall.

Kvothe's saga, a symphony untold,
In every word, in every fold,
His name echoes through the ages vast,
A story of the Wind, bound to last.
